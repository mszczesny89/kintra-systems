    <h3>This Is Not a Web Studio.</h3>

    <p class="lead">Kintra Systems exists for one reason: to design and implement full-scale business operating systems.
    </p>
    <p>We don’t “build websites”. We engineer how companies function.</p>
    <p>A website is only one interface in a much larger system — and often not the most critical one.</p>

    <h3>What You’re Actually Buying</h3>
    <p>When you work with Kintra Systems, you’re not buying design or development time.</p>
    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li>a structured operational foundation</li>
      <li>a clear business logic and process model</li>
      <li>a system that replaces fragmentation with control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We build companies as functional systems — not visual concepts.</p>

  <h3>Built Around Your Industry</h3>

  <p>Generic systems produce generic results.</p>
  <p>We design systems that align with your industry standards, real-world workflows and operational constraints —
    instead of forcing your business into predefined tools.</p>
  <p>Kintra Systems works with businesses such as:</p>

  <ul class="industry-aware-list">
    <li>construction and technical companies</li>
    <li>service-based operations</li>
    <li>inspection and compliance-driven firms</li>
    <li>specialized teams and small organizations</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="bottom-note">When the industry has rules, the system must respect them.

  <div>
    <h3>We Don’t Adapt to Broken Industries.<br>We Rebuild Their Systems.</h3>

    <p>Most companies operate on outdated tools, manual processes and disconnected software.</p>
    <p>We replace that with structure, automation, operational visibility and scalability.</p>
    <p class="highlight">Not by copying what already exists — but by engineering it properly.</p>

      If you want a company that actually works — you’re in the right place.
