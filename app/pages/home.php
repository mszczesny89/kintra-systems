  <h2>We Don’t Build Software.</h2>
  <h1>We Build Operating Systems for Companies.</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    Kintra Systems designs and implements custom-built business systems —
    aligned with how your company actually operates, not how templates assume it should.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t start with interfaces. We start with structure, logic, and process.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Architecture, workflows, internal tools, automation, data flow,
    cost control, project logic — all engineered as one coherent system,
    designed specifically for your industry and built to scale.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    If your business relies on scattered tools, manual work, and improvised processes,
    you don’t need another app.
    <strong>You need a system.</strong>
